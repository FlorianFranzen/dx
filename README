# dx: Collection of Decentralized Toy Algorithms

This is a small collection of code experimenting with libp2p under Rust.

Currently it only implements a simple on-disk truststore and a simple peer-to-peer protocol that exchanges the status between peers in form of git hashes (SHA-1).

## Things to do next

 - Complete behavior to keep track of states
 - Simplify status updates inside protocol
 - Make status protocol symetric
 - Retrieve actual status from local git repo
 - Switch from file to distributed trust store
